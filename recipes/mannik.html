    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is a traditional Russian baking, which is cooked on any occasion as a bread, cake (if you put some filling and topping). It has a very porous texture and is soft and fragile, it will surely please even the most capricious - in addition it cooks very simply, without special techniques and super ingredients.

        <li>Semolina - 1 cup </li>
        <li>Buttermilk/Youghurt/Kefir - 1 cup </li>
        <li>Sugar - 1 cup</li>
        <li>Butter - 100 g</li>
        <li>Egg - 2 pieces</li>
        <li>Salt - 0.25 tsp </li>
        <li>White flour - 1 cup </li>
        <li>Baking powder - 10 g</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract - 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Dark chocolate - 100 g for the filling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the semolina in a bowl, add the kefir and mix well so that they are not lumpy. Let this composition soak the semolina well for about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>After this time you will notice that the composition will thicken well.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter and mix with the sugar.</li>
        <li>Add this composition to the semolina with kefir and mix well.Then add eggs and salt, mix well.</li>
        <li>And the last one is flour mixed with baking powder, vanilla and chocolate cut into small pieces.Mix well with the target.</li>
        <li>Pour the dough into a tray lined with baking paper (here I have a silicone tray, so do not spread it and do not grease it with anything) and put it in a preheated oven at 200 degrees for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Be careful not to keep it too long in the oven, 30 minutes is very enough - the cake browns and grows nicely.</li>
        <li>Leave it in the tray for about 15 minutes then take it out carefully and put powdered sugar or melted white chocolate on top.</li>
        <li>Serve with great pleasure and enjoy Good appetite!</li>

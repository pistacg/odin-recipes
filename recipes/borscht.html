    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken thighs, water (or broth), and bay leaves in a 
            large pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes.Remove the chicken and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Add the cabbage into the broth and simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a meantime, preheat the oil in a large pan. Cook the onions and garlic, 5 minutes, until aromatic and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and beets and cook, stirring occasionally, for another 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the saut√©ed veggies to a pot along with tomato paste, vinegar (or lemon juice), pepper, and salt. Cover and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Chunk the cooked chicken and discard the bones. Return the chicken thighs to the soup, and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. Try and check for the seasonings. <br> If the soup is not sweet enough, add a pinch 0f sugar. If it's not sour enough, add a little of extra lemon juice or vinegar. If it's too thick to your liking, add some boiling water or broth.</li>
        <li>Off heat and let the Borscht stay for some time to allow all the flavours to mingle. Serve with yogurt or sour cream, dill, and bread. Keep leftovers refrigerated for 3-4 days. Enjoy!</li>
